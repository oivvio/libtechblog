Title: Liberationtech has a blog!
Date: 2018-12-19 10:20

It's been a while since I've had a programming blog.  Nine years if
the [Wayback
machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20120118203041/http://pipedreams.polite.se)
is to be believed.

I've missed it. Every now and then there's some programming related
stuff that I feel like sharing with the world. This will be the place
for that.  I've been using this domain as a business card for
Libertiontech. That stuff is now under [portfolio](/pages/portfolio).


See you all in 2019.
